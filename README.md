# Pawprint backend API documentation
This is powered by Slate. Everything below this section is from the original Slate README.md.

You can view the documentation right away by opening [`build/index.html`](build/index.html) in your web browser.
* To update the documentation, add or edit Markdown files to the `source/includes` directory,
then update `index.html.md` to add your section to the table of contents.
* To regenerate the `build` directory after making edits, follow the below guide to set up slate,
then run `bundle exec middleman build --clean`.


Getting Started with Slate
------------------------------

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or OS X** — Windows may work, but is unsupported.
 - **Ruby, version 2.3.1 or newer**
 - **Bundler** — If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

### Getting Set Up

1. Fork this repository on GitHub.
2. Clone *your forked repository* (not our original one) to your hard drive with `git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/slate.git`
3. `cd slate`
4. Initialize and start Slate. You can either do this locally, or with Vagrant:

```shell
# either run this to run locally
bundle install
bundle exec middleman server

# OR run this to run with vagrant
vagrant up
```

You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567. Whoa! That was fast!

Now that Slate is all set up on your machine, you'll probably want to learn more about [editing Slate markdown](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Markdown-Syntax), or [how to publish your docs](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Deploying-Slate).

If you'd prefer to use Docker, instructions are available [in the wiki](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Docker).

### Note on JavaScript Runtime

For those who don't have JavaScript runtime or are experiencing JavaScript runtime issues with ExecJS, it is recommended to add the [rubyracer gem](https://github.com/cowboyd/therubyracer) to your gemfile and run `bundle` again.
