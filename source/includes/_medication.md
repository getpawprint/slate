Gets a medication for a pet. Medications come from the `pet_medication` table.

, in which case the `source` field will have the value `pet_medication`,
or the `inferred_medication_raw` table, in which case the `source` field will have the value `inferred`. Inferred medications come from the output of a
natural language processing algorithm run over the `vet_pet_history`, `vet_reminder` and `vet_invoice` tables, so they cannot be deleted.

Gets suggested medications for a pet. These suggestions come from running algo tagging on the `vet_pet_history`, `vet_reminder` and `vet_invoice` tables.
Users should be able to accept or reject these suggestions - accepting will go to the "Add Medication" page with the
fields pre-populated by this API, and then a new medication will be added to the `pet_medication` table.
Medications already in the `pet_medication` table will not appear in the suggested medications queue.

If the suggestion is rejected, then the medication will not appear in the queue again unless there is more vet data
at a later date which suggests the same medication.
